            <div class="blog-content">
                <p>This week, I started exploring the fascinating world of machine learning. My initial focus has been on understanding supervised learning algorithms like linear regression and decision trees. The math can be challenging, but seeing the practical applications is incredibly motivating.</p>
                
                <p>I began by working through Andrew Ng's classic Machine Learning course on Coursera, which provides a solid theoretical foundation. To get hands-on, I've been playing with Scikit-learn in Python, a fantastic library that makes implementing these algorithms surprisingly straightforward.</p>

                <h4>Key Concepts I've Grasped So Far:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Supervised Learning:</strong> Training a model on labeled data (input-output pairs).</li>
                    <li><strong>Linear Regression:</strong> Finding the best-fit line to predict continuous values. I practiced this by predicting housing prices based on features like size and number of bedrooms from a sample dataset.</li>
                    <li><strong>Decision Trees:</strong> Tree-like models of decisions and their possible consequences, used for both classification and regression. Visualizing these trees helped me understand how they make predictions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Model Evaluation:</strong> Understanding metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) for regression and accuracy/precision/recall for classification.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>One of the "aha!" moments was realizing how feature scaling (like normalization or standardization) can significantly impact the performance of certain algorithms, especially those that rely on distance calculations.</p>

                <h4>Challenges and Next Steps:</h4>
                <p>The biggest challenge right now is internalizing the mathematical underpinnings, especially for more complex algorithms. My next steps are to delve into:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Logistic Regression for binary classification problems.</li>
                    <li>Understanding overfitting and techniques to combat it, like cross-validation and regularization.</li>
                    <li>Exploring a more complex dataset and trying to build a predictive model from scratch.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>It's a steep learning curve, but I'm excited to see where this journey into ML takes me and how I can apply these skills to engineering problems in the future!</p>
