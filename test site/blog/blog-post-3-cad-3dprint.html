            <h2>Getting Started with CAD for 3D Printing</h2>
            <p class="post-meta-detail">Posted on <time datetime="2023-08-01">August 01, 2023</time> by Your Name</p>

            <div class="blog-content">
                <p>I've always been intrigued by the magic of 3D printing – the ability to transform a digital design into a physical object. This summer, I finally decided to dive in and learn Computer-Aided Design (CAD) software to start creating my own printable models. I chose to start with SolidWorks, as it's widely used in engineering and our university provides licenses.</p>

                <h4>The Initial Learning Curve:</h4>
                <p>The SolidWorks interface, with its myriad of toolbars and options, was admittedly a bit daunting at first. I started with some basic tutorials on YouTube and the built-in SolidWorks tutorials. The key concepts I focused on initially were:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Sketching:</strong> Learning to create 2D sketches with precise dimensions and constraints. This is the foundation of any 3D model.</li>
                    <li><strong>Extrusion and Cuts:</strong> The fundamental operations for turning 2D sketches into 3D shapes by adding or removing material.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fillets and Chamfers:</strong> Adding rounded or beveled edges to make designs more robust or aesthetically pleasing.</li>
                    <li><strong>Assemblies:</strong> Learning how to combine multiple parts into a single assembly, though I haven't delved too deeply into this yet.</li>
                </ul>

                <!-- Optional: <img src="../images/cad_screenshot.png" alt="Screenshot of my CAD software"> -->

                <h4>My First "Real" Design and Print:</h4>
                <p>After a few weeks of practice creating simple shapes and objects, I decided to tackle a practical project: designing a custom phone stand. I wanted something simple but functional that could hold my phone at a comfortable viewing angle.</p>
                <p>The design process involved several iterations. I sketched out ideas on paper, then translated them into SolidWorks. I paid close attention to dimensions, ensuring the stand would be stable and the slot for the phone would be the right size. Exporting the model as an STL file for the 3D printer was straightforward.</p>
                
                <!-- Optional: <img src="../images/3d_printed_phone_stand.jpg" alt="My 3D printed phone stand"> -->

                <p>The moment of truth was watching the 3D printer (a Prusa Mini at our university's makerspace) bring my design to life, layer by layer. Holding the finished product, an object that had only existed as a digital file hours before, was incredibly satisfying! It wasn't perfect – there were a few minor imperfections from the printing process – but it worked!</p>

                <h4>What's Next?</h4>
                <p>This experience has only fueled my interest further. I plan to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Explore more advanced SolidWorks features like sweeps, lofts, and surface modeling.</li>
                    <li>Learn about designing for manufacturability, specifically considering the constraints and capabilities of 3D printing (e.g., overhangs, supports).</li>
                    <li>Design and print custom enclosures or parts for my electronics projects.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Learning CAD has opened up a new dimension of creativity and problem-solving for me. It's a valuable skill for any engineer, and I'm excited to continue developing my abilities.</p>
